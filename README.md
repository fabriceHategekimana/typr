## Installation

To install TypR, you will need to install `Rust` and `Prolog`:

- Rust's installation page: https://www.rust-lang.org/
- Prolog's installation page: https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable

You should be sure those tools are installed and accessible through the terminal.

After that, you just need to install the executable:

```bash
cargo install typr
```

And you're good to go.

## Usage

Actually, the executable of TypR can only type-check the targeted file. The prefered file extension is `.ty`. For instance, if you want to execute the `app.ty` file you just need this command:

```bash
typr app.ty
```
